Idea:
- Doing some sort of re-ordering of a JPEG image to allow for progressive decode is quite complex since it requires
huffman tables to be constructed for the data

- The data is also run length encoded, adding additional complexity

- Remember if we are writing our own compressor we can just use some pre-built huffman tables
