- Not sure how communication over autopilot works so this interface spec is limited for now:
- It may be that the autopilot sends and recieves 'packets' of data from the payload, or it may be that shared memory is used to communicate between the two systems
- If we are using shared memory we can still have basic packet structure

- Basic packet structure:
[0xFF (to denote this is a packet, we may not actually need this)] [ Command ID (identifies the packet) ] [ ... misc other bytes depending on Command ID ... ] [ (optional) error checking e.g. modulo 2 of every bit ]

- Modulo 2 (CRC) error checking may be useful

- We need to decide if we want to acknowelege each packet as it comes

- If we need to send variable length data we should simply do [ Length of data ] [ Data ]

GS = Ground Station
PL = Payload
Messages:
	- GS > PL: Take Picture [ Take Picture Message ID ]
		- PL should send back Picture Taken message
	- PL > GS: Picture Taken [ Picture Taken Message ID ] [ Image ID ]
	- GS > PL: Image Download Request [ Image Download Request Message ID ] [ Image ID ]
	- PL > GS: Image Data [ Image Data Message ID ] [ Image Packet Number ]
	- GS > PL: Set Colour Type [ Set Colour Type Message ID ] [ Colour Type ]
	- GS > PL: Set Image Resolution [ Set Image Resolution Message ID ] [ Image Resolution ]
	- GS > PL: Set Colour Type and Image Resolution [ Set Colour Type and Image Resolution Message ID ] [ Colour Type and Resolution (all one byte) ]

	- We may also need a general ACK message which could be sent in acknowelegement of any message
		- Could be [ ACK Message ID ] [ ID of Message ACK is for ] possibly we could add some checksum bits too

Steps for GS to take image:

1. GS sends Take Picture message and waits for Picture Taken message
2. When GS gets Picture Taken message it remembers the Image ID and Image Size
3. Loop until all image downloaded:
	4. The GS sends Image Download Request message for the next set of bytes in the image and waits for an Image Data message
	5. When the GS gets the Image Data message it stores the data in the message to a JPEG file.
